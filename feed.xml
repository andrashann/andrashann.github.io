            <p><em>On May 7, 2022 a <a href="https://qubit.hu/2022/05/07/hova-tunt-a-735-os-ut">Hungarian version of this article</a> has been published on Qubit.hu, a Hungarian popular science website.</em></p>

<p>I have been wondering for some time about the system behind the numbering of roads in Hungary. The system itself is simple: the main road that leads from Budapest to Vienna is number 1, the other main roads radiating out from the capital are numbered in clockwise sequential order. Connecting roads have two (or sometimes three) digits. But <em>why</em> is this the system? How long has it been like this? What happened when the borders of the country changed?</p>

Alternatively, you might want to have a backup with you on paper if anything goes wrong with your device. I wrote a simple web service that helps you with the second case.</p>

            <p>According to my analysis, it is likely that there is, but this seems not to be the case in other, more densely populated localities.</p>

                </p>
            
            <p>In this article I explore a method to visualize linear spatial data that changes over time: which segments of tram line 6 of Budapest were under construction at which points in time? This investigation is inspired by a <a href="https://index.hu/video/2020/06/15/4_6_villamos_felujitas_nagykorut_negyes_hatos_husz_ev_alatt/">video</a> posted on Index.hu and a 140-year-old <a href="http://marlenacompton.com/?p=103">train schedule diagram</a>.</p>

            <p>About two years ago, I shared an <a href="/articles/2018/nicely-formatted-transit-schedules/">article</a> about a project where I query and process results from the Google Transit API in a way that provides a simple overview for public transport connections between two places. Since I ended up using it rather frequently, I decided to turn it into a proper Python package, called <em>gptt</em>, available on <a href="https://github.com/andrashann/gptt">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/gptt/">PyPI</a>.</p>

            <p>Last year we organized an internal conference at my workplace and I volunteered to put together a booklet with the abstracts of the presentations. I wanted to add photos of the authors, but I did not want them to look all the same. I came up with the idea to have the photos on top of two rectangles of the same size but of two different colors, a bit offset from the photo – every photo should be paired with differently offset rectangles to add some unique design. Of course, I did not want to do this by hand, but that’s what I know Python for.</p>

The motivation behind creating it was simple: I wanted to automate tasks that I had done by hand too many times.</p>

            <p>It really was a great idea. As usual, I took a problem that I randomly ran into and wanted to find a solution to. I was not sure if I could implement the solution, but I knew I could describe it. It happened when I was working on a project where I got some data about municipalities in Hungary. I thought it would be handy to sort them alphabetically so that the user of the final product can easily find the place they are interested in. However, due to the unusual letters in the Hungarian alphabet, such as <em>ő</em> or <em>gy</em>, collation is not trivial. But I knew I could find a way to solve this!</p>

            <p>I was going through the documents of my great-grandfather, Lajos Frenyó when I found a couple of folded papers in one of the notebooks. I had already known that he really liked hiking but I did not have any material proof of this hobby apart from the photo used as the cover image of this post. That is, up until that moment, because these papers contained a very detailed account documenting two trips in the Tatra mountains. This post contains these two reports with my comments.</p>

            <p>Do you know what a COYOTE TOOTHACHE and a CHECKBOOK PHOTOCOPY have in common? If written in uppercase, all the letters of these expressions appear in the Cyrillic alphabet.<span class="sidenote"> That is, if we take a more relaxed definition of letters being the same shape: in many typefaces, K and К and Y and У do not look the same, just <em>very</em> similar. </span> Although, to be precise, if somebody would try to read these using the Cyrillic alphabet, they would read “souote tootnase” and “sneckvook rnotosoru”, respectively.</p>

<p>I started thinking about this when I realized that I had never seen a Russian license plate with letters that do not also appear in the Latin alphabet. So I started to wonder about two things: is this observation true in general? If so, what words could we make up that would consist only of such letters?</p>

            <p>I enjoy hiking, which most of the times involves using public transportation to get to the start of my hike and to get back home. Planning these trips used to be a major chore in Hungary before 2016, as there was no unified schedule database: one could only plan trips by train <em>or</em> bus, not together.  During these times I came up with a timetable format in which I manually collected transit options using the bus and train planner websites as well as a map to came up with potential routes. These days transit information is available via the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/start">Google Directions API</a>, so I decided to revisit this format and I developed <a href="https://github.com/andrashann/generate-nice-timetables">a script</a> that creates it automatically.</p>
