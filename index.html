I thought it would be handy to sort them alphabetically so that the user of the final product can easily find the place they are interested in. However, due to the unusual letters in the Hungarian alphabet, such as <em>ő</em> or <em>gy</em>, collation is not trivial. But I knew I could find a way to solve this!</p>

          <div><p>I enjoy hiking, which most of the times involves using public transportation to get to the start of my hike and to get back home. Planning these trips used to be a major chore in Hungary before 2016, as there was no unified schedule database: one could only plan trips by train <em>or</em> bus, not together.  During these times I came up with a timetable format in which I manually collected transit options using the bus and train planner websites as well as a map to came up with potential routes. These days transit information is available via the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/start">Google Directions API</a>, so I decided to revisit this format and I developed <a href="https://github.com/andrashann/generate-nice-timetables">a script</a> that creates it automatically.</p>

I could not ignore the fact that the Sun has very different patterns: it rises later and sets later here than in Budapest. However, this difference is not uniform: my feeling was that the sun rises much later and sets about the same time during the winter. I saw the inverse in the summer: Dutch summer evenings are much longer, but dawn does not lag behind that much. I wanted to verify this feeling in a scalable manner, so I created a <a href="http://hann.io/sunrise-sunset/">website</a> (code <a href="https://github.com/andrashann/sunrise-sunset">here</a>) where you can pick two arbitrary locations on the globe and see a graph with their dawn/dusk times through the year.</p>

          <div><p>I always found it fascinating that there are several bus stops in Hungary which are called “{municipality name}, Cooperative Liquor Store” (<em>szövetkezeti italbolt</em> in Hungarian). It might get somewhat lost in translation that such a name very much reminds the reader of the socialist era it was given to the bus stop.</p>

          <div><p>Hungarian municipalities have unique names that consist of one (potentially compound) word. This was not the case until the end of the 19th century: multiple villages could have the same name, sometimes even in the same county. This caused trouble not only for the postal service but also related to taxation and conscription. Hence the standardization: every name must be unique; in case of a duplcate, the municipality names got a prefix based on their general location. I investigated these prefixes: their spatial distribution and the origin of those names.</p>

To me, this sounds like a bad idea.</p>
